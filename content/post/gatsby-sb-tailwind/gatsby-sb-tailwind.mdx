## Integrate Storybook with TailwindCSS support into a GatsbyJS site

How much time would it save you if projects could be built faster and more reliably?

In my experience, one of the most time consuming portions of a new website or application
is the creation of components and overall UI

Even with third party tools such as <ExternalLink href="https://material-ui.com/">Material-UI</ExternalLink> or <ExternalLink href="https://tailwindcss.com/">TailwindCSS </ExternalLink>
it still takes entirely too long to build reusable UI Components

In addition to building the component we also have to configure it with events
and integrate it into the application to make sure it works properly

How are we supposed to get anything done!

### Enter Storybook!

Storybook provides an environment in development where we can create the components
in isolation

This is huge because we can create the component and make sure it functions as
intended with `stories`

Another major bonus is that I can test events (click, hover, etc) and different props

Storybook has some great documentation for configuration with many different JavaScript projects <ExternalLink href="https://storybook.js.org/">Storbybook</ExternalLink>

One configuration that is missing is integrating Storybook into GatsbyJS with TailwindCSS support<ExternalLink href="https://www.gatsbyjs.org/">Learn more about Gatsby </ExternalLink>

We will focus on configuring Storybook into a Gatsby project that uses TailwindCSS

### Getting Started

If you do not already have gatsby installed then open a command terminal and run

```bash
npm install -g gatsby-cli
```

I have a Gatsby project already configured with TailwindCSS

```bash
git clone https://github.com/ethriel3695/theme-contentful-quick-start.git

cd theme-contentful-quick-start
```

4. Open the repo in your favorite code editor

   - I use VS Code so I run `code .`

In the same terminal or in the VS Code terminal run

```bash
npm install -g @storybook/cli
```

The command installs the Storybook cli globally so you can use it across various projects

We then want to run `yarn` to install the quick-start packages and then
`sb init --type react` in your project directory

The `--type react` is important because Storybook may not be able to detect
the application type you are building

The `sb init --type react` command will install `.storybook` in the root directory of your project
It also installs all the Storybook dependencies and will create a file `.storybook/main.js`

In order to get the storybook webpack file to register Components correctly override the file
`.storybook/main.js` with the following:

```js
const path = require('path');
module.exports = {
  // You will want to change this to wherever your Stories will be
  stories: ['../src/stories/**/*.stories.js'],
  addons: ['@storybook/addon-actions', '@storybook/addon-links'],
  webpackFinal: async config => {
    // Transpile Gatsby module because Gatsby includes un-transpiled ES6 code.
    config.module.rules[0].exclude = [/node_modules\/(?!(gatsby)\/)/];
    // use installed babel-loader which is v8.0-beta (which is meant to work with @babel/core@7)
    config.module.rules[0].use[0].loader = require.resolve('babel-loader');
    // use @babel/preset-react for JSX and env (instead of staged presets)
    config.module.rules[0].use[0].options.presets = [
      require.resolve('@babel/preset-react'),
      require.resolve('@babel/preset-env'),
    ];
    config.module.rules[0].use[0].options.plugins = [
      // use @babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties for class arrow functions
      require.resolve('@babel/plugin-proposal-class-properties'),
      // use babel-plugin-remove-graphql-queries to remove static queries from components when rendering in storybook
      require.resolve('babel-plugin-remove-graphql-queries'),
    ];
    // Prefer Gatsby ES6 entrypoint (module) over commonjs (main) entrypoint
    config.resolve.mainFields = ['browser', 'module', 'main'];

    config.module.rules.push({
      test: /\\.css$/,
      use: [
        // Loader for webpack to process CSS with PostCSS
        {
          loader: 'postcss-loader',
          options: {
            sourceMap: true,
            config: {
              path: './.storybook/',
            },
          },
        },
      ],
      include: path.resolve(__dirname, '../'),
    });

    return config;
  },
};
```

Then run

```bash
yarn add -D babel-preset-react-app
```

Then, create a file in the `/.storybook` directory
and name it `preview.js` with the following:

```js
import { action } from '@storybook/addon-actions';
// import { GlobalStyle } from '../src/shared/global';
// These are the global styles for TailwindCSS
import '../src/gatsby-theme-contentful/styles/style.css';
import React from 'react';
// Add viewport addon for mobile responsive development.
import { addParameters, configure } from '@storybook/react';
// import { INITIAL_VIEWPORTS } from '@storybook/addon-viewport';
global.__BASE_PATH__ = '';
// automatically import all files ending in *.stories.js
configure([require.context('../src/stories', true, /\.stories\.js$/)], module);
// Gatsby's Link overrides:
// Gatsby defines a global called ___loader to prevent its method calls from creating console errors you override it here
global.___loader = {
  enqueue: () => {},
  hovering: () => {},
};
// Gatsby internal mocking to prevent unnecessary errors in storybook testing environment
global.__PATH_PREFIX__ = '';
// This is to utilized to override the window.___navigate method Gatsby defines and uses to report what path a Link would be taking us to if it wasn't inside a storybook
window.___navigate = pathname => {
  action('NavigateTo:')(pathname);
};
```

The next step is to create a folder in your `src` directory and name it `stories`
Add your stories to this folder

Here is a setup example for a Button component
Add a file `Button.stories.js` and the following:

```js
import React from 'react';
import Button from 'gatsby-theme-contentful/src/components/Button/Button';

export default {
  title: 'Button with inherit styling from the style.css file',
  component: Button,
};

export const ExternalLinkButton = () => (
  <Button key={'link-button'} href={'https://mulejs.org'}>
    MuleJS
  </Button>
);

export const InternalRouteButton = () => (
  <Button key={`internal-route-button`} to={`/blog`}>
    Blog
  </Button>
);
```

The amazing thing is that you don't need to configure Contentful
and get all the other pieces of the quick-start ready because
Storybook will run independently

Just run `yarn run storybook` and Storybook will fire up!

In summary, Storybook is a great tool to use if you don't already have
a design library or standard and want to build components quickly
without having to configure a project to work with each component

In combination with TailwindCSS, you have a quick and easy way to
create components and build the UI part of an application quickly
