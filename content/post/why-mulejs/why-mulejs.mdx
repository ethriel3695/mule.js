#### There are four things I love in this world

- My family
- Creating via Software Development
- Assisting People via teaching
- My mule Penny

I know how hard it was for me to get started in the software development world
The journey is long and sometimes you go it completely alone and don't know what to do next
There are so many frameworks out there now that make web development easier
However, I have yet to find a tool that allows me to build dynamic, modern web applications quickly and easily
There is so much configuration involved and reading docs, watching tutorials, copying Github repository snippets and it is tiresome

##### MuleJS is my desire to fix this problem

- Less project configuration
- CMS driven for easy content creation
- Style quickly with a style.css file and TailwindCSS
- Ready for production including Google Analytics, automatic bundling, static site generation, SEO with React Helmet
- The goal is to be able to avoid all these complex configurations and just start on your project from the beginning

**Please NOTE** this is not another framework

I'm building MuleJS utilizing GatsbyJS, Contentful, Auth0, TailwindCSS, Storybook
