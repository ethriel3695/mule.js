#### There are four things I love in this world

- My family
- Creating via Software Development
- Assisting People via teaching
- My mule Penny

I know how hard it was for me to get started in the software development world
The journey is long and sometimes you go it completely alone and don't know what to do next
There are so many frameworks out there now that make web development easier
However, I have yet to find a tool that allows me to build dynamic, modern web applications quickly and easily
There is so much configuration involved and reading docs, watching tutorials, copying Github repository snippets and it is tiresome

#### The Vision

My vision is to reduce the barrier of entry to be a Software Engineer. In 2020 and beyond, UI design and
project configuration "should" be easy so that anyone can get started.

A stepping stone for people entering the Software Industry!

The reality is that a Software Engineer role would adapt to provide new solutions
we haven't even thought about yet for web development but first we absolutely need
easy tools to create projects quickly and efficiently.

The process of UI creation and project configuration is ideally semi-automated or
fully automated in the near future.

I fully recognize that I may not be the one that solves this **BUT** I am sure as
hell going to contribute to the solution!

#### What currently exists

There are already plenty of "no-code" solutions rising up in the industry such as<ExternalLink href="https://webflow.com/"> Webflow, </ExternalLink><ExternalLink href="https://www.squarespace.com/">SquareSpace, </ExternalLink><ExternalLink href="https://www.shopify.com/">Shopify, </ExternalLink> <ExternalLink href="https://thenextweb.com/neural/2020/07/23/openais-new-gpt-3-language-explained-in-under-3-minutes-syndication/">GPT-3 by OpenAI</ExternalLink> and many more!

The problem with most of these current solutions is they get you started but there is a Chasm between getting you started and building real, reusable and sustainable projects!
In addition, some of these tools are not intuitive to use and require a bit of work to even build something small.
Bridging that gap...

**Enter MuleJS**!

##### MuleJS is my desire to provide a solution

- Less project configuration
- CMS driven for easy content creation
- Style quickly with a style.css file and TailwindCSS
- Ready for production including Google Analytics, automatic bundling, static site generation, SEO with React Helmet
- The goal is to be able to avoid all these complex configurations and just start on your project from the beginning

**Please NOTE** this is not another **FRAMEWORK**

Frameworks have altered the course of web development for the future and in a great way!
However, they take lot's of learning and configuration which is what we **DEMAND** less of!

I've built MuleJS utilizing GatsbyJS, Contentful, Auth0, TailwindCSS, Storybook
